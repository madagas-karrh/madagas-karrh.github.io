<!-- # Company — presskit.html -->

<!--
  **This is your company page**. It should not focus on a specific product, but present your whole company. The journalists won't, most of the time, know you or your studio. With this page, you will have an opportunity to show your people, your work, your history and your contributions in a standard format. This is not a replacement for your website, but a quick way for the press to know you faster.

  [Check the actual rendered page for the code you'll find below.](http://pixelnest.io/presskit.html/example/)

  If you don't have a `data.xml` yet, the easiest way to start is to run this command in your presskit folder:

  ```bash
  presskit new -t company
  ```

  Then, open the generated `data.xml` file and fill the blanks while following this guide.

  Okay… ready? Let's do this.

  <hr>

  For your products' `data.xml`, [refer to the product documentation](../product/).

  <hr>
-->

<!-- Don't forget to set your XML header correctly. -->
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

<!--
  Use a `<company>` tag for your main `data.xml` file. **It will be the root page of your presskit.**
-->

  <!-- ## Description & History -->

  <!-- The description is a simple short block to describe your company or studio. Be brief. -->
  <description>
    Madison Karrh is a solo developer, focused on making short personal games full of heart. She is inspired by libraries, bugs, bones and decay.

  <!--
    Tell your story with the `<history>` tag.

    You have two possibilities here.

    - Use an `<histories>` block like in the example.
    - Or use a single `<history>` block if you don't have much to say.

    You can't have both.

    Example of a single block:

    ```xml
    <history>
      Hello, world.
    </history>
    ```
  -->
  <histories>
    <history>
      <header>Landlord of the Woods</header>
      <text>Landlord of the Woods is a game about feeling behind all of your peers. Released March 2021. https://store.steampowered.com/app/1564090/Landlord_of_the_Woods/ </text>
    </history>
    <history>
      <header>Whimsy</header>
      <text>Whimsy is a game about a walk through the forest. Released December 2019. https://store.steampowered.com/app/1170370/Whimsy/</text>
    </history>
  </histories>

  <!-- ## Trailers -->

  <!--
    Add your videos. Because we are in the `<company>` page, try to be representative of all the products of your company.

    You can use YouTube and/or Vimeo. Only one is needed, and only one is recommended.

    Don't put the full link: just the ID is necessary.

    If you want to provide a link to download the video, add this tag in `<trailer>`:

    ```
    <download>https://example.com/video.mp4</download>
    ```
  -->


  <!-- ## Awards, quotes & links -->

  <!--
    You got awards? Great! Put them here.

    But don't add too much here: this is your company page, not a product one.
  -->


  <!--
    Quotes are used to show the appreciation of your users.

    Show something important, something nice, or something funny, for example.
  -->


  <!--
    Need to link to a resource? A small product? An RSS feed?

    You want to show your blog? Your personal Twitter account?

    Put those here, in the `<additionals>` tag.
  -->


  <!-- ## Team & Contacts -->

  <!--
    This is for your people.

    Add yourself, of course, but also your **frequent** collaborators for example.

    If a collaborator has only worked on one product, add her/him on this product page instead.

    The `<role>` tag can be anything you want. But we recommend to, at least, put the company name for the founders/employees. This will distinguish this person from the external collaborators.

    The `<website>` tag is optional.

  <!--
    Add more contact information.

    For the company page, you can repeat your social network accounts, as well as another contact mail address, or your company website.

    For each item, pick one between a `<link>` and `<mail>` tag.
  -->
  <contacts>
    <contact>

      <mail>madison@wetheart.games</mail>

    Well-done, it's over for this one. ;)
