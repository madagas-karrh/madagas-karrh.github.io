<!-- # Product — presskit.html -->

<!--
  **This is your product or game page**. It should focus on _ONLY_ one product. This is not a replacement for your product's website, but a quick way for the press to know it faster.

  [Check the actual rendered page for the code you'll find below.](http://pixelnest.io/presskit.html/example/product/)

  If you don't have a `data.xml` yet, the easiest way to start is to run this command in your presskit folder:

  ```bash
  presskit new -t product
  ```

  Then, open the generated `data.xml` file and fill the blanks while following this guide.

  <hr>

  For your company' `data.xml`, [refer to the company documentation](../company/).

  <hr>
-->

<!-- Don't forget to set your XML header correctly. -->
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

<!--
  Use a `<product>` or `<game>` tag.
-->
<product>
  <!-- ## General Information -->

  <!-- Begin with your product name, website, and miscellaneous information. -->
  <title>Birth</title>
  <website>https://www.wetheart.games/</website>

  <!-- You can also add an URL to a request page for this product. A button will be displayed on the page. -->


  <!--
    If you have one or many publishers for this product, you can add them here.

    The `<based-in>` and `<website>` tags are optional.

  <release-dates>
    <release-date>17 Feb, 2023</release-date>

  <!--
    Put all the platforms your product is available on.

    `<link>` tag is optional.
  -->

  <!-- ## Relations -->

  <!--
    You can specify relations between products using the `<relations>` tag.


    Then, on this page product, you will see a new line in the factsheet:

    ```
    DLC:
    My Super Game: Ultimate Edition
    ```

    Of course, the `Product Name` value is clickable.

    In the related product page, a new value will also be added:

    ```
    DLC of:
    My Super Game
    ```

    _Obviously, since the name we provide in the example is not a real product (ie., the product data.xml does not exist), this tag will be ignored for this page._

    You can have as many relations as you want. You can use it to show DLCs, expansions, sequels, prequels, etc.

    **Warning**: you need to rebuild the presskit to see the changes.

  <!-- ## Description & History -->

  <!-- Describe your product here. Be brief. -->
  <description>
    Birth is an adventure puzzle game about constructing a creature from spare bones and organs found around the city in order to quell your loneliness. 
  </description>

  <!--
    Tell the story of your product with the `<history>` tag.

    You have two possibilities here.

    - Use an `<history>` block like in the example.
    - Or use an `<histories>` block if you have tons of things to say.

    You can't have both.

    You can see an example of the `<histories>` block in the company page.
  -->
  <history>
    Birth is developed solely by Madison Karrh. She has spent most of her twenties living alone in tiny studio apartments. Birth is her exploration of day-to-day loneliness.
    Every piece of Birth is hand-drawn and doused with love, feeling and a bit of grief. Enjoy.
  </history>

    Need to link to a resource? A small product? An RSS feed? An OST?

    A press release?

    Put those here, in the `<additionals>` tag.

    **Optional.**

  <!-- ## About -->

  <!--
    An "About Your Company" section is automatically generated from the content of the company page.

    This <abouts> tag is completely **optional**. If you don't want this section, just delete it. But sometimes, you want to add a description for a partner.

    This is this the place to do it.

    For example, if you have a publisher, you can speak a bit more about it here.

    Most of the time, you should link that to the <partner> tag above, if you want to explain a partner a bit more. But you could use this section for other purpose.

    The <link> tag is optional.

  <!-- ## Team & Contacts -->

  <!--
    This is for the product team.

    Add yourself, of course, but also your collaborators, freelancers and/or partners for example.

    The `<role>` tag can be anything you want. But we recommend to, at least, put the company name for the founders/employees. This will distinguish this person from the external collaborators.

    The `<website>` tag is optional.
